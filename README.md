Design patterns are fundamental in the life of a developer.

# Type of design patterns

## Creational Patterns

- [ ] Factory : You have a 'factory' and you can create 'instance' using 'factory.create(...)' for example.
- [ ] Builder : You have a 'builder' with individual method, for example '.addX(...).addY(...)' then you can do '.build()' to get your instance.
- [ ] Singleton : A class with only 1 instance in the whole app. You can get this instance by using 'ClassY.getInstance()' for example.

## Behavioral Patterns

- [ ] Observer : You can be 'subscribe()' to a class to listen changes and be notify.
- [ ] Iterator? : A linked list with a next()
- [ ] Strategy : For example, you can remove number in a list using .filter(FilterClass()).

## Structural Patterns

- [ ] Adapter : ...
- [ ] Facade : Simplify using simple method.
