# Type of design patterns

## Creational Patterns

- [ ] Factory : You have a 'factory' and you can create 'instance' using 'factory.create(...)' for example.
- [ ] Builder : You have a 'builder' with individual method, for example '.addX(...).addY(...)' then you can do '.build()' to get your instance.
- [ ] Singleton : A class with only 1 instance in the whole app. You can get this instance by using 'ClassY.getInstance()' for example.
